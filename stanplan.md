Stan's personal plan
===

Overview
-----
I will manage the input of data from the 'NIFFTE-alphas.dat' file into an appropriate format for analysis
and manipulation by my team members.

Format of input
---
The input comes from the data file provided by Prof. Klay, and is a text file with 100 events, each containing ~100
lines of individual points.

Format of output
---
I will pass a package of data in the format: List of events, with each event containing a list of numpy arrays.
Each array is in the format [Volume Row Column Bucket ADC].
